# lyrebird-old

***This is not representative of my current code. This is an old project. For a redone version of this, check: https://github.com/AbdullahJasim/lyrebird-new***

This is an old assignment I had done for an operating systems class.
The assignment required us to create a connection between a server and multiple clients. The server would distribute files for clients, and clients would attempt to decrypt the files.

The code was written in C, designed for Ubuntu OS.

I have decided to redo the assignment using C++ and Windows OS. This one is for comparison reasons only.
