This is an old assignment I had done for an operating systems class.
The assignment required us to create a connection between a server and multiple clients. The server would distribute files for clients, and clients would attempt to decrypt the files.

The code was written in C, designed for Ubuntu OS.

I have decided to redo the assignment using C++ and Windows OS. The redone version will be in a different project / repo. This one is for comparison reasons only.
